# Battery Buddy ðŸŽ§ðŸ”‹

Never get caught off guard by a low battery again! Battery Buddy is a simple yet powerful Python script that keeps an eye on your deviceâ€™s battery level. When your charge drops to 50% or below, Battery Buddy will alert you with a voice message, ensuring you always have time to plug in and keep going.

This script leverages the `psutil` library to monitor your battery status and the `playsound` library to deliver timely audio alerts. Itâ€™s like having a vigilant friend whoâ€™s always looking out for your deviceâ€™s battery health.

And the best part? Battery Buddy is always evolving. I'm currently working on features like automatically increasing the volume if itâ€™s set to zero, so you never miss an alert.

and remember - with Battery Buddy, youâ€™re always charged up! ðŸ”ŒðŸ’»
